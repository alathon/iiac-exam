\textbf{\LARGE{Part one: Design Project}}
\todo[inline]{Part one is a design project report as described
    in the coursebook. The audience for this is the companies
    management. See e.g.\ page 186ff.

\section{Objective}

\subsection{Objective of the design project}
\todo[inline]{Quick recap of the requirements from the manager, and what goals 
    the system is designed to fulfill}
The focus of the design project is to improve upon the booking process used by 
\gomonkey. The booking process is currently very manual and only ever handled by 
the manager. The manager said that: 

\begin{quotation}
I don't dare letting my employees handle the bookings.

\em - Michel Pascual, manager and owner of \gomonkey, 15.10.2013
\end{quotation}

He is afraid they will make mistakes, since the process is complex and not very 
well documented. Some bookings may also contain cases which the manager is not 
yet sure of how should be handled, and thus needs an authority to handle and  
produce a best practice for \gomonkey. While the manager does spend a lot of
time handling bookings, this takes time from actually evolving the business.
The goal of the design project is to put the booking process into a 
well defined system and reduce the complexity and time required for handling
incoming bookings. This will reduce the workload put on the manager, thus 
empowering him to focus on other areas of the business.

\subsection{Results from the in-depth analysis}
\todo[inline]{Observations, standard systems, work practices}

\subsubsection{Standard systems}
\todo[inline]{Describe standard systems tested and why they do not meet our 
requirements.}

We compiled a list of possible standard systems and isolated three very possible
candidates. After deep testing sessions of all systems, we realized that none
of them fulfill the defined requirements in the design project.

\begin{description}
\item[SuperSaaS]
We decided not to use SuperSaaS, since the booking doesnâ€™t support the required 
fields for the booking. A 'form' can be attached to a booking after submitting 
initial information (intial information being the date and time of booking, 
name, phone number and email address), and this 
form can include extra information about amount of people in each age group, the
type of customer and food. This information can only be seen with two clicks 
from the calendar overview, thus making it impossible to get a good overview of 
how 'available' a time slot is.

Furthermore, it is not possible to calculate a price based on the custom fields 
in the form, and as such, the system cannot ask for a deposit so we will still 
need another payment processor.

\item[onlinebooq.dk]
The second promising booking system was onlinebooq.dk. They support selling 
'services', but unfortunately they only support selling one of each servive.
This can be seen in figure \autoref{fig:onlinebooq} as the checkbox, next to the 
service in question. This makes it useless for \gomonkey, since the price is 
calculated from the amount of people utilizing each service. It does support 
paypal and quickpay, but this doesn't matter if we cannot calculate the price 
correctly.

        \label{fig:onlinebooq}
\end{figure}
		

\item[Cyberbooking]
The last booking system we tested was Cyberbooking. They have two types of 
calendars, one which supports one resource (e.g. a hairdresser) who can only
perform one service at a time. The other type supports booking slots on 
predefined events, (e.g. a fitness session) and the events are set by the 
company. None of these types can help \gomonkey{} with the booking process,
since the amount of resources aren't limited to one group of customers, and 
the times of bookings are very flexible.

\section{The coherent vision}
\subsection{Technology and systems}
\subsubsection{IT systems and platform}
\todo[inline]{What do we need for running the system. Servers, software, etc}

\subsubsection{Functions of the system}
\todo[inline]{Describe what the system does}

\subsubsection{User interaction}
\todo[inline]{Pictures of mockup and descriptions of how it works}

\subsection{Work organization}
\todo[inline]{Do we change how the work organization is, someone with new
responsibilities? Can someone potentially do some of the managers work?}

\subsection{Qualification needs}
\todo[inline]{Does the system require any education? The manager will probably
need to tell about the new system to the instructors, and the manager will have
to be 'taught' how to use the new system.}
	
\subsection{Advantages and disadvantages}
\subsubsection{Business- and IT strategies}
\todo[inline]{How the system will help reach the goals described in the
    business- and IT strategies.}

\subsubsection{Groups of staff and their relations}
\todo[inline]{Advantages and disadvantages from an employees and the managers 
    perspective, and how the it system affects their communication and 
    relation.}

\subsubsection{Customers}
\todo[inline]{Advantages and disadvantages from a customers perspective.}
