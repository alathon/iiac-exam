\section{Part two - analysis, discussion and reflection}
\todo[inline]{Lead-in text for this part. Describe what the
section aims to provide. 1/2 to 1 page.}

Part two of this report explores the question of \textit{why}
the design process occured as it did. We attempt to provide a
partial answer to this question by looking at the process from
a more academic point of view than in part one, as well as considering
several different key choices or techniques used in more detail.

Part two is split into the following sections:
\begin{inparaenum}[i)]
\item a brief description of techniques used in the design process
\item an overview of the entire design process from start til end
\item a detailed look at a few of the key choices and techniques employed
\end{inparaenum}

\subsection{Overview of techniques employed}
\todo[inline]{Describe every technique used and how it was used, cite relevant
articles for other uses or longer description}

\begin{description}
    \item [Baseline Planning]
    \item [Interview]
    \item [Observation]
    \item [Diagnostic Mapping]
    \item [Market study]
    \item [Think-aloud experiment]
    \item [Document analysis]
    \item [Developing scenarios]
    \item [Experimenting with prototypes]
    \item [Workshop]
    \item [Future workshop]
\end{description}

\subsection{From beginning to end: Our process of design}
\todo[inline]{Describe what we did from the very beginning
til the end. 2-3 pages}

\subsection{Combining the in-depth and innovation phases}
\todo[inline]{Describe how we combined the in-depth and
innovation phases, and how the literature also supports
this in certain cases. 2-3 pages}

\subsection{Ethnographically inspired analysis}
\todo[inline]{Describe how to combine techniques to provide
an ethnographically inspired analysis. It is not good enough
to know \textit{what} they do, we must also know \textit{why}.
1-2 pages}

\subsection{Observation as a technique}
\todo[inline]{Describe how observation works as a technique.
Describe how others have used observation to positive effect.
Describe how we have used observation, and what some of the
pitfalls are. Briefly cite and describe one alternative to
observation. 1-2 pages}

\subsection{User stories as a technique}
\todo[inline]{Describe how user stories work as a technique
to provide overview and structure workflow. Describe how we
performed this and provide relevant sources for others who
use user stories to case out design or implementation of
projects. Describe some of the pitfalls. Briefly cite and
describe one alternative to user stories. 1-2 pages}
